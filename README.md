## Build and run

First of all, get the source code!

To build and run it on your device. Enter the project folder form your terminal window and execute the following command:

```
fuse build --target=iOS
```

... use `Android` instead of iOS for Android. See [Fusetools.com](http://fusetools.com/) for more information on how to build your Fuse application.

Now, use Xcode to deploy it on your device! :)
